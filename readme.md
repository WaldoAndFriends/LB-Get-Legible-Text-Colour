# Get legible text colour - LB Extension
This extension for Lioranboard can help you decide what colour would be the best for your text, based on the provided HEX colour code of the background colour.
It returns either "black" or "white" so you can decide what colour to use for your text source.

I.E. given a dark background colour the extension will return "white."

## Download
